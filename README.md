I have created "Public Github Repositories Website using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap". My project gives a detailed information about the projects made by a specific user and also the technical and non-technical skills of the user along with his profile details.It describes about each and every project of the user including code files.
Not only the user ther team members can contribute to the code,suggest changes and discuss issues.Repositories act as a backup of your code. If something goes wrong, you can revert to a previous version easily.
Repositories can host documentation for your project.
A well-maintained README file and other documentation within the repository help users understand how to use and contribute to the project. 
Public repositories provide a platform for others to discover, use, and contribute to your work.Private repositories offer a secure space for proprietary or sensitive projects.
If your project is open source, a repository allows you to build a community around your project.Contributors and users can interact through issues, pull requests, and discussions.
And finally, repositories streamline collaboration, enhance project management, and provide a structured environment for code development and maintenance.
Steps to run the code: Install VS code(visual studio code) from chrome,copy and paste each web page as provided separately and run the code.
When you click on specific project title,there you find all details of the project with files.You can make changes in your profile as well as projects.
If my Github repositories are public,then anyone can contribute,submit issues and pull requests to my project.
Thank you "Fyle Technologies" for giving me this assignment. It helped me to learn more new thing and to check my skills.I might not designed it as it is, but I have covered all the requirements.
